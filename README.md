# **Malaria Detection**

## **Problem Definition**

### **The context**

  Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through infected mosquitoes. It remains a significant global health concern, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare resources. The importance of solving the problem of malaria detection using computer vision lies in its potential to aid in early and accurate diagnosis, which can significantly impact patient outcomes. Timely detection of malaria can facilitate prompt treatment and reduce mortality rates. Furthermore, automated malaria detection can alleviate the burden on healthcare professionals, especially in resource-constrained areas, by providing a rapid and cost-effective screening method.

### **The objectives**

  The goal is to develop a computer vision model based on convolutional neural networks to detect malaria parasites in blood cell images. Specifically, the objectives are:

  - **Accuracy**: To create a model that can accurately identify whether a given blood cell image is infected with malaria or not.

  - **Generalization**: To develop a model that generalizes well to various types of blood cell images, regardless of variations in colors, shapes, luminosity or other factors.

### **The key questions**

  - **What kind of dataset is available?** It's crucial to know the characteristics of the dataset, including the size, quality, and diversity of blood cell images, as well as making sure they are correctly labeled.

  - **What architecture and hyperparameters should be used for the CNN?** Selecting the appropriate CNN architecture and hyperparameters significantly impact the model's effectiveness.

  - **How will the model be evaluated?**
  Appropriate evaluation metrics for classification must be considered, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as a confusion matrix.

### **The problem formulation**

  We aim to develop a computer vision model that can accurately classify blood cell images as either infected with malaria parasites or uninfected. This model will contribute to the early and efficient diagnosis of malaria, which is crucial for timely treatment and improved healthcare outcomes. By leveraging CNN, we seek to build a robust and efficient solution that can be deployed in healthcare settings, particularly in regions with limited access to medical resources, ultimately contributing to the global fight against malaria.

### **Data Description**

There are a total of 24,958 train and 2,600 test images (colored) taken from microscopic images. These images are of the following categories:


**Parasitized:** The parasitized cells contain the Plasmodium parasite which causes malaria.

**Uninfected:** The uninfected cells are free of the Plasmodium parasites.
